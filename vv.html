            <p>Her and I were strangers who happened to share an abusive ex, so as I went looking in the dark for answers -  she appeared like a dream. As a way to heal we went to the beach to bond by filming two seperate independent projects, now sometimes when I dream I can still feel the sun burning into me.

            <p>Like life, everything can and does exist on their own to a certain extent. So I would like you to play each video one at a time. </p>
            <p>However life is not that simple - It's a series of complex layers</p>
            <p>So play them at the same time and experience how layers truly create our reality.</p>
            <br>
            <p>As I continously, strive to re-imagine lived experiences - there is a need to saturate the seconds. This is a study on the isolation of sounds with the same or similar media.</p>
